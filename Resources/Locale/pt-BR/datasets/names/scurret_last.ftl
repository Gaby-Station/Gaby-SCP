# Scurrets from Planet Wawa have two parts to their name - a 'chosen' and 'qualitative' name.

# The qualitative name is usually related to an important feature
# of Wawa's wetland habitats that the scurret is associated with
# by their community.

# Scurret pups, due to both their quantity and complete lack
# of any survival instinct, lack a qualitative name entirely.
# Researchers believe their parents simply give them a number.

# Given that the scurret language is untranslated, these names are
# usually deduced via the showing of photographs, annoyed and
# repeated pointing at nearby objects, or games of Pictionary.

# When all else fails, to NT and her crews, Wa is as good a name as any.
