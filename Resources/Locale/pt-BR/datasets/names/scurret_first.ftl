# Scurrets from Planet Wawa have two parts to their name - a 'chosen' and 'qualitative' name.

# The chosen name is picked by the scurret themselves,
# encompassing a trait or value they hold themselves
# to or have a high value for. Scurrets sometimes change this
# name to denote an important moment in their life.

# It appears to be common for scurret sets to share the same
# chosen name, with the gaining of a pup's own chosen name
# signalling their transition to adulthood in the community.

# Given the scurret language is untranslated, these names are
# usually guessed via charades or Pictionary.

# When all else fails, to NT and her crews, Wa is as good a name as any.
